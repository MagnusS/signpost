# Installation:

It is important that both the server and clients run the same version of
iodine. We use version 0.6.X.

## MacOSX
The version in homebrew is 0.5 and should not be used. Instead install from
[source](http://code.kryo.se/iodine/iodine-0.6.0-rc1.tar.gz)

## Ubuntu 11.X

    sudo apt-get install iodine
    # Check that the version is right:
    iodine -v
    # If not version 0.6.X then, install from source
