System to form a personal VPN infrastructure between devices and
computers.

It will use the VPN capabilities to automatically establish a secure
feed between devices (e.g. Laptop/iPhone/iPad) and a coordination
server that will initially live on the cloud (e.g. as an Amazon
Micro AMI).

Still in alpha, not for public use.
